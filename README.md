# OpenBioSim - sire integration / big tests

[![Build](https://github.com/OpenBioSim/sire_bigtests/actions/workflows/main.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/OpenBioSim/sire_bigtests/actions/workflows/main.yaml)

This repository contains a historical set of larger tests that are useful to run periodically
to ensure that the sire legacy API is not broken. These also provide a good set of 
integration tests for [sire](https://sire.openbiosim.org).

We do not plan to add more tests to this repository. It is kept only to preserve the 
legacy API.

New tests should be added as 
[described on the website](https://sire.openbiosim.org/contributing/development.html#testing).
